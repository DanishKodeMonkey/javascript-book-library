# Javascript Book Library

## An exercise in javascript object oriented programming and inheritence.

### Description

The javascript book library is a page that allows you to line up your favorite books!

It features a nicely wooden shelf that you can add books to, with a dialog modal that appears
when you try to add a book, fill that out and the script will handle the form data,
put it through a constructor and add the object to an array, as well as create a nice book card on the
shelf!

### Coming soon

Later I will be adding some storage to save your choice of books!
